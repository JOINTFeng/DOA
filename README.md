# Root-MUSIC Fast Decoherence Algorithm for Uniform Circular Array Eigenvector Reconstruction
To address the issue that the feature vector reconstruction algorithm, which performs well on Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA), cannot be directly applied to Uniform Circular Arrays (UCA) for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation of coherent signals, this paper proposes a Mode and Eigenvector Reconstruction MUSIC (MERM) algorithm. Utilizing Davies' mode space transformation method, the UCA is preprocessed and transformed into a Virtual Uniform Linear Array (VULA). By performing eigenvalue decomposition on the received data matrix and extracting the dominant eigenvector, the covariance matrix is reconstructed, enabling the steering vector of the UCA to attain a Vandermonde structure. This approach also reduces the impact of direction-finding errors after preprocessing. Finally, the azimuth angles of coherent signals are estimated using the Root-MUSIC algorithm. The MERM algorithm demonstrates strong capabilities in resolving coherent signals, high direction-finding accuracy, and does not require spatial smoothing, thereby reducing computational load and enhancing algorithmic real-time performance. Simulation experiments have validated the feasibility of this algorithm.
